## Social Media Analytics Module
### Project Overview
This project is a Social Media Analytics Module designed to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts. The module uses Groq's LLM model (Llama3.1-8b-instant) for advanced natural language processing, allowing it to generate insights based on various post types such as Reels, Carousels, and Static Images. The front end is built using Streamlit, and the project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and interaction.

### Tech Stack
#### Backend:

**Groq LLM** : I used Groq's Llama3.1-8b-instant model to process and generate natural language insights based on social media engagement data.
**Langflow**: A Python library for constructing workflow-based applications. It was used to integrate the LLM and automate the processing of social media engagement data.
**DataStax Astra DB**: A cloud-based NoSQL database that stores the engagement data. I created a sample database to simulate real-world social media data, including metrics like likes, shares, comments, and post types.

#### Frontend:

**Streamlit**: The user interface is developed with Streamlit, allowing easy interaction with the system. The front end accepts user input (post types) and displays generated insights in real-time.

#### Deployment:

**Streamlit Cloud**: The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for seamless deployment, making the app accessible to users over the internet.
### Key Features
#### Social Media Insights:

The module accepts different post types (e.g., Carousels, Reels, Static Images) and provides engagement metrics like likes, comments, shares, and saves.
Based on the data, it generates actionable insights like “Reels have 2x higher comments than Static Images.”
Data Fetching and Processing:

Data is stored in DataStax Astra DB, simulating social media engagement data.
The system uses Langflow to create workflows that fetch data from the database and analyze it using the Groq LLM.
Real-time Analytics:

The insights generated by the system are displayed in real-time on the Streamlit front end. As users select different post types, the system provides up-to-date analytics.
Important Python Libraries
Langflow: Used for creating workflows and integrating GPT models like Groq Llama3.1-8b-instant.
Groq: For leveraging the Llama3.1-8b-instant LLM model to generate insights.
DataStax: Cloud-based database solution to store and query the social media engagement data.
Streamlit: Frontend library for building the interactive user interface and deploying the app.
### How to Use
Clone the repository:


git clone [https://github.com/sakp7/analytics-assignment](https://github.com/sakp7/analytics-assignment)

Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

Access the app on Streamlit Cloud- Link - https://analytics-assignment.streamlit.app/

### Database
The sample database in DataStax Astra DB stores simulated engagement data, including metrics for likes, shares, comments, and post types (Reels, Carousels, Static Images).
The database is structured to support efficient queries for the analytics module to fetch engagement metrics and calculate average performance.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to integrate modern AI models like Groq’s Llama3.1-8b-instant with a data-driven frontend for social media analytics. It leverages the power of Langflow, Groq, DataStax Astra DB, and Streamlit to create a seamless, real-time analytics experience for social media managers and content creators.
